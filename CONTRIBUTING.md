# Contributing to Gin Blueprint

Thanks for considering contributing! This is a straightforward starter kit, so contributions are pretty simple.

## What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes
- Better examples
- Documentation improvements
- Performance improvements
- New middleware that's generally useful
- Better project structure suggestions

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Highly specific features (build those in your own fork)
- Alternative ORMs (this is a GORM template)
- Framework replacements (this is a Gin template)

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test it works (`go build` and `go run main.go`)
5. Commit (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
6. Push (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Keep it simple
- Follow Go conventions
- Don't over-engineer
- Add comments only where needed
- Run `go fmt` before committing

## Testing

We don't have tests yet (PRs welcome!). For now, just make sure:
- The code builds without errors
- The server starts successfully
- Basic CRUD operations work

## Questions?

Open an issue. I'll respond when I can.
